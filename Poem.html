    <h1>The Velvet Room</h1>
        <P><em>Asleep...Yet awake? An Aria fills the room. Velvet blue around you. </em></P>
        
    <p><em> An old man with a long nose sitting at a table near you, with an assistant who's...so blue. </em></p>
        
        <p>"Welcome to The Velvet room my dear yong guest. Where we shall help you to your request." The man said. </p>
        
        <p><em>Velvet Room is he kidding? All I see is blue thats what I'm seeing. And what with this elevator that seems to go nowhere?</em></p>
        
        <p>"Why the destination of course, however as you can see. We are not even close. That is why we are here. To help you out. Shall you refuse? Well that is silly no doubt." </p>
        
        <p><em>Silly? Destanation? What is that old man talking about? I just feel kind of tired. Just need sleep...Thats all i need right now.</em></p>
        
        <p>An alarm is heard. As I keep looking around the old man laughs. "Our time is up. Goodbye for now."</p>
        
        <p><em>I awake in my room. Boring as usual but what was in that dream? I want to see more it seems. </em></p>
        
        <p><em> The day passes by and I lie in my bed. Closing my eyes. Drifting off to see where the room led.</em></p>
        
    <p><e>"Welcome to the Velvet Room. My dear young guest." And I smile at him. A bit impressed. </e></p>
